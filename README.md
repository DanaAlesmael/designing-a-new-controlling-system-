# designing-a-new-controlling-system-

The main focus on this task was to design a controlling system that can separate boxes depending on their sizes to reduce the work time on people. For this reason, ultrasonic sensor was utilized to measure the distance from its location to the box location. With everything done, it can be noticed that increasing the distance means the box is smaller. All the work and results are included here as Tinckercad was used. A demo video was included to prove and show how the sensor works. 


In circuit2 and demo2, a servo motor was attached to control the movement of the boxes using if statement. Meaning, range of distances should be specified in the code. Approximate values were utilized for now just to check if the connection would work or not. At the end, I successful completed this task and boxes should be separated.
